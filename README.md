Models are structured so that all of the inputs are in the "Input" folder. Only the scenario.txt and scenario.bat files live in the "Model Runs" folder. This is designed to be a lighter-weight way to organize the model runs, so the rasters and IC and climate files are not copied for each run, and each run can easily call a different set of parameters just by modifying the scenario.txt file.
